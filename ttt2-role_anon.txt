The Anonymous is a simple evil role that, like a serial killer, needs to kill everyone who isn't on there team. Unlike a serial killer, the Anonymous has friends (up to 3 by default, modify ttt_anonymous_max to change this). However, the Anonymous isn't told who's on their team, and they're individually far weaker than a serial killer, so social deduction is heavily encouraged.
 
Under the hood, when an Anonymous role is selected that role will, just as the game is about to begin, set a number of base innocents to be Anonymous. This means that if there are too few players or the server has too many roles that it tries to assign, there will be fewer Anonymous players than expected. Regardless, the Anonymous player will be told how many friends they have for the game.
 
To further encourage social deduction one can alter the Anonymous role's shop to be a subset of the traitor shop.
 
For an less difficult experience, consider increasing ttt2_anon_max_num_known, which can be used to tell the Anonymous player some of who their friends are.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
 
[h1]Normal Role Convars (also found in ULX):[/h1]
[code]# enable or disable this role
  ttt_anonymous_enabled [0/1] (default: 1)
# the percentage of players that are spawned as this role
  ttt_anonymous_pct [0.0..1.0] (default: 1.0)
# the limit of players that spawn as this role each round, this overwrites the percentage
  ttt_anonymous_max [0..n] (default: 3)
# the probability each round of this role being spawned at all
  ttt_anonymous_random [0..100] (default: 30)
# the amount of players needed for this role to spawn
  ttt_anonymous_min_players: [0..n] (default: 9)[/code]
 
[h1]Rolespecific Convars:[/h1]
[code]# The maximum number of fellow living Anonymous players that the player is informed about upon spawn.
  Note1: When an Anonymous spawns, there will always be at least one Anonymous player that they will not be told about (ex. this ConVar does nothing if there's only 2 Anonymous players).
  Note2: This only applies to players with the Anonymous ROLE. A player who joins the Anonymous TEAM without also having the role tells them nothing.
  Note3: A player who gains this role mid-round will not be told about dead Anonymous players.
  ttt2_anon_max_num_known [0..n] (default: 0)[/code]
